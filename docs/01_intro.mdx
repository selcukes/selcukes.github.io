## Getting Started

Before you start, you will need to install a few prerequisites.

#### Install Node LTS
You can download the [installer](https://nodejs.org/en/) for Windows, use[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or run the command below on Linux:
```shell
sudo apt install nodejs
```

#### Install Appium
Install Appium from the command prompt or terminal by running:
```shell
npm install -g appium
```
Confirm the installation by running the following command:
```shell
appium -v
```
#### Install Appium Doctor
To validate if all the setup is done correctly to run your tests with Appium, install Appium Doctor by running the following command:
```shell
npm install -g appium-doctor
```
Run the following commands to check the setup for Android and iOS:
```shell
appium-doctor --android
appium-doctor --ios
 ```
 This command will check if the setup is done correctly. If there are any issues with the mandatory components, it will try to fix them automatically. If it canâ€™t fix them on its own, it will mention the steps to follow to fix the issues.
 
#### Java 11

Since Selcukes uses Java 11, make sure you have a [JDK 11 or later](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) installed.

#### IDE
You will need a modern IDE such as [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download) or Eclipse to work with Java.

#### A Build Tool
You will need either [Gradle 3.x or higher](http://www.gradle.org/downloads) or [Maven 3.3.x or higher](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) to run your tests and generate reports.

### Quick Start
To quickly create a new project, clone the starter project from the [selcukes-java-skeleton](https://github.com/selcukes/selcukes-java-skeleton) repository on Github.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/selcukes/selcukes-java-skeleton.git
cd selcukes-java-skeleton
```
Alternatively, you can download a zip file from [here](https://github.com/selcukes/selcukes-java-skeleton/archive/master.zip).

#### So far so good?

The starter project comes with a demo test that you can run.
To run the test from the command line, run either:

```shell
$ mvn clean verify
```

or

```shell
$ gradle clean test
```
That's it! You're now ready to start creating and running automated tests with Selcukes.
