# Introduction

Selcukes is an open source library that aims to build high-quality and highly scalable automated tests

## Features
- Easy add new logic to your tests without causing regression issues. Control the whole execution workflow - change browsers or reuse them. Retry your failing tests to make sure that there is a real problem.
- Automate UI actions or user scenarios on real devices or emulators with Selcukes features from test creation to execution.
- Cross-platform screenshot and video recording on test failure

## Getting Started

### What you need to start

#### Install Node LTS
On Windows, you can download the [installer](https://nodejs.org/en/). On Mac, you could simply use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install Node. Similarly, on Linux, you can run the following command:
```shell
sudo apt install nodejs
```

#### Install Appium
Please follow the instructions below to install Appium:
From the command prompt or terminal, install Appium using the following command:
```shell
npm install -g appium
```
Once Appium is installed, you can confirm by checking the installed version by executing the following command, and you will see the version of Appium installed on your machine.
```shell
appium -v
```
#### Install Appium Doctor
Since we have already installed Appium on our machine, we must now validate if all the setup is done correctly to run our tests with Appium. To check this, there is another library called appium-doctor.

To install this library, we must run the following command:
```shell
npm install -g appium-doctor
```
Once this command is executed successfully, run the following command to check the Android setup,
```shell
appium-doctor --android
```
And to check setup for iOS, run:

```shell
appium-doctor --ios
 ```
This command will check if the setup is done correctly or not. If there is some issue in the setup of mandatory components, it will try to fix it automatically. If it canâ€™t fix on its own, it will mention steps to follow to fix the issues and complete the setup successfully.

#### Java 11

Test Automation is a development activity, so you will need some familiarity with Java.
Selcukes uses Java 11, so make sure you have a [JDK 11 or later](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) installed.

#### IDE

You will need a modern IDE to work with Java.
We recommend IntelliJ (you can download the Community Edition, which is free, from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download).
But Eclipse will work fine as well.

#### A Build Tool

You will also need a build tool, either Gradle or Maven, to run your tests and generate your reports.
Make sure you have either [Gradle 3.x or higher](http://www.gradle.org/downloads) or [Maven 3.3.x or higher](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) installed.

### Quick Start
The quickest way to create a new project is to take one of the starter projects on Github.
You can find the starter project for TestNG at [selcukes-java-skeleton](https://github.com/selcukes/selcukes-java-skeleton).

You can clone this repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/selcukes/selcukes-java-skeleton.git
cd selcukes-java-skeleton
```


Or simply download a zip file from [here](https://github.com/selcukes/selcukes-java-skeleton/archive/master.zip).

#### So far so good?

The starter project comes with a demo test that you can run.
From the command line, run either

```shell
$ mvn clean verify
```

or

```shell
$ gradle clean test
```
